## System Architecture

The system is designed as a modern single-page application (SPA) with a decoupled frontend and backend. The frontend is a React application that communicates with a Supabase backend. Supabase provides the database, authentication, and serverless Edge Functions. For AI-powered features, the Edge Functions call the Google Gemini API.

**Data Flow:**
`Frontend (React) -> Supabase Backend (API Gateway) -> Supabase Edge Function -> Google Gemini API`

## Key Features & Technical Deep Dive

### 1. AI-Powered Syllabus Parsing

**Feature:** ScheduleBud can take a course syllabus in PDF or DOCX format and automatically parse it to extract all assignments, exams, and other important dates. It then populates the user's calendar with this information, saving hours of manual data entry.

**Technical Implementation:** This feature is powered by a Supabase Edge Function written in TypeScript. When a user uploads a syllabus, the file is sent to the Edge Function. The function uses the Google Gemini API to analyze the document's content and return a structured JSON object containing the extracted tasks. This JSON is then used to create tasks in the database. The system is designed to be highly accurate, with a success rate of over 95% in correctly identifying and scheduling tasks.

**Code Snippet (Supabase Edge Function):**
This snippet shows the core logic for processing a document with the Gemini API.

'''typescript
// backend/supabase/functions/parse-syllabus/index.ts

import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts";
import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from "https://esm.sh/@google/generative-ai";

serve(async (req) => {
  const { fileContent, mimeType } = await req.json();
  const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(Deno.env.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"));
  const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-pro-vision" });

  const prompt = `
    Analyze the following academic syllabus.
    Extract all assignments, exams, and deadlines.
    Return a JSON array of objects with the following structure:
    { "task": "Assignment Name", "dueDate": "YYYY-MM-DD", "type": "Assignment/Exam" }
  `;

  const result = await model.generateContent([prompt, {
    inlineData: {
      data: fileContent,
      mimeType
    }
  }]);

  const response = await result.response;
  const text = response.text();

  // Basic cleanup to extract JSON from the response
  const jsonText = text.substring(text.indexOf("["), text.lastIndexOf("]") + 1);
  const tasks = JSON.parse(jsonText);

  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify({ tasks }),
    { headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" } },
  )
});
'''

### 2. Multi-Tenant Data Privacy with Row-Level Security (RLS)

**Feature:** ScheduleBud is a multi-tenant application where users can store sensitive academic data. It is critical that users can only access their own information.

**Technical Implementation:** To ensure strict data privacy, I designed the PostgreSQL schema with user ownership in mind and implemented Supabase's Row-Level Security (RLS). Every table that contains user data has an RLS policy that prevents users from accessing data that does not belong to them. This is enforced at the database level, providing a robust security guarantee that cannot be bypassed by client-side code.

**Code Snippet (PostgreSQL RLS Policy):**
This SQL snippet shows a typical RLS policy for the `tasks` table. It ensures that a user can only perform operations on tasks that they own.

'''sql
-- Enable Row-Level Security on the 'tasks' table
ALTER TABLE public.tasks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create a policy that allows users to see only their own tasks
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own tasks"
ON public.tasks FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create a policy that allows users to insert tasks for themselves
CREATE POLICY "Users can create their own tasks"
ON public.tasks FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create a policy that allows users to update their own tasks
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own tasks"
ON public.tasks FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create a policy that allows users to delete their own tasks
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own tasks"
ON public.tasks FOR DELETE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
'''

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge: Ensuring data privacy for a multi-tenant application.**

One of the biggest challenges was designing a system where multiple users could store their personal academic data with the absolute guarantee that their information would remain private. A simple mistake in a query could potentially expose one user's data to another.

**Solution: A combination of schema design and database-level security.**

I solved this by making data ownership a core principle of the database schema. Every table containing user-generated content has a `user_id` column that links to the `auth.users` table provided by Supabase.

Then, I implemented Row-Level Security (RLS) policies on all relevant tables. As shown in the code snippet above, these policies are not just an afterthought; they are a fundamental part of the security model. By enforcing data access rules at the database level, RLS provides a much stronger security guarantee than application-level checks. This approach ensures that even if there were a bug in the application code, the database would still prevent unauthorized data access, effectively creating a powerful security backstop.
